## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
This project is a Student portal , I made it using PERN Stack (PostgreSQL,Express,Reactjs,Node.js), for my college . It has the following features:

- Students can login with their username & password to check their marks in last semester.
- Teachers can upload the marks of the students of their respective subject by logging into portal using their username & password.
- Admin has the all the rights to check students marks in each semester , check faculties with their subjects in each semester , make a new account for newly joined faculty or student.

**Portal Link:** https://gnit-portal.herokuapp.com/

## ðŸ“Œ Approach Used

- Functional Programming paradigm is used.
- TDD (Test Driven Development) is followed.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Structure

Root folder is divided into two sub folders:

- client - It has all the client side code . It's made using Reactjs.
- server - It has all the backend logic needed for the portal to work . It's made using Express.
- .github - It contains all the files & workflows related to GitHub.

Complete folder structure is as follows:
